The CMC repository provides tools and software to enable remote attestation of computing platforms,
as well as remote attested TLS channels between those platforms. Currently, the CMC repository
supports Trusted Platform Module (TPM) attestation, as well as AMD SEV-SNP attestation. The goal
is to make attestation easy for verifiers without prior knowledge of the software stack, based
on a set of trusted CAs and signed metadata describing the software stack.

*A detailed description of the architecture can be found in our*
*[paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3600160.3600171) and in the*
*[documentation](doc/Architecture.md)*

## Prerequisites

- A Linux platform
- For TPM attestation, access to `/dev/tpm0`.
- For AMD SEV-SNP an SNP-capable AMD server
- Building the *cmcd* requires *go* (https://golang.org/doc/install)

## Quick Demo Setup

The CMC repository contains a complete local example setup including a demo CA and all required
configurations and metadata. It was tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

> :warning: **Note:** You should run this only for testing on a development machine, or inside
> a Virtual Machine (VM). The software directly interacts with the hardware (TPM or AMD SP).

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Fraunhofer-AISEC/cmc.git
```
Create a demo PKI and all required metadata:
```
./cmc/example-setup/setup-full-simple <cmc-folder> <metadata-folder> json
```
`<cmc-folder>` is the relative or absolute path to the cloned `cmc` repository.
`<metadata-folder>` is an arbitrary folder that will be created and that will store metadata and
configuration files. `json` specifies JSON as the serialization format. `cbor` is possible as well.

For the JSON example configuration folders to work without modifications, choose as `<metadata-folder>`
the folder `cmc-data` located in the same root folder the `cmc` repository resides in.
Export this root folder as `$CMC_ROOT`.

*For an alternative demo setup with a more complex PKI and policies based on the requirements of*
*the International Data Spaces (IDS), see [IDS Example Setup](./doc/ids-example-setup.md)*

*For instructions on creating and signing the metadata with an arbitrary PKI yourself,*
*see [Manual Setup](./doc/manual-setup.md)*

## Run

### Generate and Verify Attestation Reports

```sh
# Start the EST server that supplies the certificates and metadata for the cmcd
./estserver -config $CMC_ROOT/cmc-data/est-server-conf.json

# Build and run the cmcd
./cmcd -config $CMC_ROOT/cmc-data/cmcd-conf.json

# Run the testtool to retrieve an attestation report (stored in current folder unless otherwise specified)
./testtool -mode generate

# Run the testtool to verify the attestation report (stored in current folder unless otherwise specified)
./testtool -mode verify -ca $CMC_ROOT/cmc-data/pki/ca.pem
```

Note that the JSON configuration files in the example setup contain relative paths and the
above commands are meant to be run from within the respective source directories inside the
`cmc` repository.

### Establish Attested TLS Connections

Instead of using the `testtool` to simply generate and verify attestation reports, it can also
be used to establish attested TLS connections:

```sh
# Run an attested TLS server
./testtool -mode listen -addr 0.0.0.0:4443 -ca $CMC_ROOT/cmc-data/pki/ca.pem -mtls

# Run an attested TLS client estblishing a mutually attested TLS connection to the server
./testtool -mode dial -addr localhost:4443 -ca $CMC_ROOT/cmc-data/pki/ca.pem -mtls
```

**Note**: The *cmcd* TPM provisioning process includes the verification of the TPM's EK certificate
chain. In the example setup, this verification is turned off, as the database might not contain
the certificate chain for the TPM of the machine the *cmcd* is running on. Instead, simply a
warning is printed. The intermediate and root CA for this chain can be downloaded from the TPM
vendor. The certificates can then be added in to the ```cmc/example-setup/tpm-ek-certs.db```
database. The ```verifyEkCert``` parameter in the *estserver* config can then be set to true.

## Configuration

The tools can be configured via JSON configuration files and commandline flags. For an explanation,
each binary can be run with the `-help` flag. All configuration options are explained in the
[Configuration Documentation](./doc/configuration.md).
